# psDevOpsTool

A PowerShell module designed to help those who work in DevOps. A one stop solution to all your tooling needs. This is a spiritual successor to my original tftools module, that helps you keep the Terraform binary up to date. The more I work with cloud native technology, the more tools get installed on my computers and the upkeep was starting to get out of hand.

This module tries to provide some _nice to have_ tooling, but mainly exists to provide a definitive way of keeping a library of you CLI tools that you can keep up to date, easily. You can read more about how this works in the [documentation](https://roberthstrand.github.io/psDevOpsTool/).
